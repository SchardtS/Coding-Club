# Data Visualization and Improvisation

## Introduction

You are given a dataset `countries.txt` that is far too vague and not perfectly standardized. However, you were given this unreasonable task to work with this to create as much of an effect as possible with your solution.

## Challenge

Find a way to work with this data. Improvise on what you will be doing with it, e.g. statistical analysis or visualization. Extend the data if necessary.

## Meeting

Our meeting will by on the 4. of December 2023 at 13:00 o'clock in Zoom (link will be posted in our Mattermost channel).
