# Image Annotation

## Introduction

We have different types of images, resulting from some crazy biological experiment thingy, which were stitched together in a tabular fashion, see example.

<img src="Readme1.png" alt="Example Image" width="800" height="400">

Unfortunately, the images are missing their annotation which should give the reader the necessary information of how long these experiments were performed. In the end, it should look somewhat like this

<img src="Readme2.png" alt="Example Image" width="800" height="400">

## Challenge

Find a way to annotate these images in such a way that the user won't have to do it by hand. Use whatever you want to solve this, i.e. programming related or specific software/websites. However, keep in mind that this should also be applicable for images of different sizes and arrangements. Try your solution for the two pictures included in this directory `NACH MONENSINMontage of Untitled-1.png` and `beta-tox.tif`.
