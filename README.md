# CCTB Coding Club

## What is the CCTB Coding Club (CCTBCC)?

The CCTBCC was brought to life in order to help improve everyones coding skills. The main concerns in most codes are
- functionality (does it actually do what it should?)
- readability (can anyone understand what the code does just from looking at it?)
- performance (is the code fast and could it be faster?)

In order to tackle this, we aim to solve specific coding challenges individually and compare our solutions in a meeting with other participants.

## Coding Challenges

Ideally, each individual challenge comes from someones own project such that the different solutions might even benefit them. This will not always be possible in which case the organizers will step in to create something fun for you. However, this might be something math related (sorry about that :wink:). About the challenges:
- They should be solvable in a short amount of time (e.g. less than one hour)
- They should be pitched by their creator, i.e. either ...
    - ... pushed directly as Markdown file (`README.md`) on the Github repo in a separate directory (include additional data if needed)
    - ... posted in Mattermost in some form
    - ... brought to the organizers discretely if it is wanted


## Meetings

We aim for voluntary bi-weekly Zoom meetings (Mondays 13:00) in which we discuss the different solutions provided by the participants. The meetings should be roughly one hour long, therefore not everyone might be able to showcase their work. Still we want to encourage everyone to volunteer especially if ...
- ... you encounter difficulties solving the problem (involving the group might improve understanding of specific concepts)
- ... you are confident in your solution in one aspect, e.g. elegance or performance (participants might benefit from your ideas)
- ... you believe your solution brings a new perspective on the problem, e.g. through an unconventional use of packages

Showcasing your code is not intended to be used for rating and/or criticizing you. The meetings should be a fun environment in which everyone helps each other leading to an overall improvement of everyones coding skills. So don't be scared to show your work, everyone of us was a beginner at some point.

## Recognition

After our meetings, every participant, not only the ones who showcased their solution, is encouraged to push their solutions on this repository. This helps us to manage past content, but also provides an incentive to get some practice with GitHub. In order to do this, just include your solution in whatever format you used (e.g. .ipynb, .py, .jl, ...) to the repository. For more than one file, put it in a directory. Simply name your file/directory after yourself for easier recognition, e.g. `Hans.py`, or in the case of duplicate names `Hans_F.py`. Additionally, we want to create additional recognition for the showcased solutions which fulfill certain criteria:
- The most elegant solution
- The fewest lines of code (not counting empty lines)
- Best performance (might be tricky to compare but we will try)

In case you fulfill any of this criteria, your file will be renamed to `Hans_(most_elegant).py` and you can eternally be proud of your achievement!
